## percolation
Percolation was assigned to further the understanding of arrays. <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/24percolation/" target="_blank">Percolation</a> is an abstract model for many physical systems. Given an n-by-n grid of sites, each site is open with probability p, the system percolates if and only if any open site in the top row in the grid is connected to any open site in the bottom row by open sites. Percolation was implemented in tandem with <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/" target="_blank">Weighted Quick Union Find</a> to simplify tracking connections between grid positions.

## transit
Transit was assigned to further the understanding of linked lists. The idea behind the project is to split one's commute into different layers and perform operations to extract information like the best path to a specific location or adding or removing stops from a particular route to mimic the dynamic changes of a transit system.

## huffman coding
Huffman coding was assigned to further the understanding of binary search trees. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> is a technique to achieve data compression without the loss of data and utilizes binary search trees to do so. The project entailed compressing the given data using principles of huffman coding and then retrieving data from the resulting binary search trees.

## rumdb search engine
RUMDb search engine was assigned to further the understanding of hash tables. The project entailed creating a custom implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">separate chaining hash table</a> that stores move titles and their corresponding descriptions to allow quick search of words from the descriptions.

## prereq checker
Prereq checker was assigned to further the understanding of graphs. The project entailed implementing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list">adjacency list graph</a> to map the hierarchy of some of the courses in the Rutgers computer science and mathematics departments. The graph was then used to make sure the valid prerequisites have been taken, find cycles, create schedules and more.
